- Create a feature class that runs after parser and assigns features to nodes:
- Link section name and shortname to section
- Boolean for starred sections
- User defined commands can have number of args, and optional args

- Keep the invariant that a node children intervals form a partition of its interval (excluding its value)
- handle end of file with inline comment without new line
